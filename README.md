# Tharuni Iranjan . Jarvis Consulting

I am a software developer with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Ontario Tech University. During my undergraduate degree, I completed courses in Full Stack Web Development, Statistics, and Machine Learning, where I honed my skills in programming languages such as Python, R, and TensorFlow. These experiences sparked my interest in data and the importance of data management and pipelining. My work experiences at Jarvis, Osler, and the City of Brampton strengthened my skills in: Java, SQL, Bash, and PowerShell. I was responsible for database management and software development, where I streamlined current processes and uncovered data insights. My exposure to an agile work environment has also equipped me with the ability to effectively manage my time and communicate and collaborate with team members. Currently, I am looking for a Data Engineering role within the financial industry where I can apply my skills and experience.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_TharuniIranjan](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_TharuniIranjan)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_TharuniIranjan/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_TharuniIranjan/linux_sql)]: This project aims to assist the Jarvis Linux Cluster Administration (LCA) team in managing a Linux cluster of 10 servers running CentOS 7. The project utilizes Linux command lines, Bash scripts, PostgreSQL, Docker, and Git. Users can write SQL queries to extract real-time resource usage data, facilitating future resource planning. The project includes a psql instance for data persistence, a bash_agent with scripts for data collection, and Docker for database provisioning. The source code is managed on GitHub, and cron is used for scheduling the agent scripts.


## Highlighted Projects
**Learning Leaf - Web Application** [[GitHub](https://github.com/TharuniI/LearningLeaf/tree/main/majorgroupproject-nng-learning-leaf/majorgroupproject-nng-main)]: This full stack website was developed during COVID-19 and was created with the intent of enhancing the online learning experience. Users can access this website through different account types and are shown their corresponding dashboard. For instance, a professor can see the stats of a lecture based on student ratings. This application was coded using JavaScript, alongside the frontend framework Vue.js. Firebase services were utilized for the backend, including: authentication, cloud functions like sending event-based email notifications, and Firestore for a real time database.

**Auction Simulator - Software Quality Assurance** [[GitHub](https://github.com/TharuniI/AuctionSim)]: Mimics an online auctioning application that allows users to login as a particular user type, and perform actions depending on their set of permissions (i.e. bid/auction/delete users/etc).Python was used for the Backend, along with Pytest for testing. C++ was used for the Frontend and a Makefile to execute the code. The project was divided into 6 phases: requirements gathering, UML design and white box testing, coding,unit/branch/system testing, deployment and acceptance testing, maintenance and regression testing. Requirements changed according to customer needs.

**Whisper - Java Application** [[GitHub](https://github.com/TharuniI/Whisper)]: An online chat server that allows multiple users to login into a group chat and see previous messages, and any new messages are sent to all online users in real time. This application was created used Java and Javafx for the GUI and includes a database to store information, and server sockets for people to communicate with each other.

**ProdClass - Machine Learning** [[GitHub](https://github.com/TharuniI/ProdClass-ThesisProject)]: A research study on the ability to automatically classify product features into positive and negative affiliations using a product review data set. The purpose of this project is to utilize customer reviews to allow companies to improve their products and subsequently increase customer purchasing. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques including sentiment analysis and text modelling was utilized to complete the task. Code was developed on Google Collab using Tensorflow and other Python libraries like scikit-learn and Pandas.
