# Introduction
Discuss the design of the project. What does this project/product do? Who are the users? What are the technologies you have used? (e.g. bash, docker, git, etc..)

# Quick Start
- Start a psql instance using psql_docker.sh
- Create tables using ddl.sql
- Insert hardware specs data into the DB using host_info.sh
- Insert hardware usage data into the DB using host_usage.sh
- Crontab setup
