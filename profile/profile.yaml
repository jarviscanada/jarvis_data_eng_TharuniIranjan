    description: This project aims to assist the Jarvis Linux Cluster Administration (LCA) team in managing a Linux cluster of 10 nodes/servers running CentOS 7. The project utilizes Linux command lines, Bash scripts, PostgreSQL, Docker, and Git to implement a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Users can write SQL queries to extract real-time resource usage data, facilitating future resource planning. The project includes a psql instance for data persistence, a bash_agent with two scripts (host_info.sh and host_usage.sh) for data collection, and Docker for database provisioning. The source code is managed on GitHub, and cron is used for scheduling the agent scripts.
