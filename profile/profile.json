      "description": "This full stack website was developed during COVID-19 and was created with the intent of enhancing the online learning experience. Users can access this website through different account types and are shown their corresponding dashboard. This application was coded using JavaScript dynamically update content, alongside the frontend framework Vue.js to build the user interface. It builds on top of standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to easily build components like scale students use to rate the lecture, and the table for professors to view the student reactions to a lecture, and more. It also has Firebase support, which was used in the backend. Services used include: authentication, cloud functions like sending event-based email notifications, and Firestore for a real time database.",

      "description": "Mimics an online auctioning application that allows users to login as a particular user type, and perform actions depending on their set of permissions. Python was used for the Backend, to retrieve and store data appropriately. Pytest was utilized to perform a series of tests. First, there was unit testing was completed to make sure each action type, like login, auction, bid, works individually. assertEquals was used to verify the expected results match actual results against some test data. Next, integration testing was completed by testing a combination of actions and comparing the results to ensure components combined properly. Finally functional testing was done to make sure the entire application was working as one unit. Once all tests were complete, the application was deployed, and changes were made according to customer needs. Regression testing was completed where we re-run functional tests to ensure the changes did not affect the overall application and its performance.",

It is to help people who want to invest but want to trial run with fake money to start off. Users are asked to enter a request type like view, buy or sell, and changes are made to the database accordingly. Java was used to develop this application with Maven as the build tool. Alpha Vantage API from RapidAPI was accessed using a GET request to access real-time stock information. JDBC was used to view/modify data in PostgreSQL. Testing was completed using Junit and Mockito.",

The application accepts three command-line arguments. The regular expression to search for, the root directory path where the search should begin, and the output file path where the matched lines will be written. Maven was used to build the Java project, Docker was used to containerize the application, and GitHub for source code management."
