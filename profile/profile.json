      "description": "A research study on the ability to automatically classify product features into positive and negative affiliations using a product review data set. The purpose of this project is to utilize customer reviews to allow companies to improve their products and subsequently increase customer purchasing. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques including sentiment analysis and text modelling was utilized to complete the task. Code was developed on Google Collab using Tensorflow and other Python libraries like scikit-learn and Pandas. Extensive research was completed on the campus library for approaches and best practices. Weekly meetings were held with my professor where we discussed progress, concerns and next steps, and a report was completed to summarize my findings.",

Users can access this website through different account types and are shown their corresponding dashboard. This application was coded using JavaScript dynamically update content, alongside the frontend framework Vue.js to build the user interface. It builds on top of standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to easily build components like scale students use to rate the lecture, and the table for professors to view the student reactions to a lecture, and more. It also has Firebase support, which was used in the backend. Services used include: authentication, cloud functions like sending event-based email notifications, and Firestore for a real time database.",

Initial research and requirements gathering was done to understand the flow of the application. Use case diagrams and ERD were created using LucidChart and Toad Data Modeler. At this stage, information like what tables were needed, what the primary keys are, what columns each table contained, how each table is connected were established. PostgresSQLâ€™s pgAdmin was used to create the table, add values, and query for certain information requested by the customer.",

        "JDBC App: The purpose of this project was to create a stock market simulator which allows an individual to view daily updates on particular stocks and buy or sell their shares at market price. It is to help people who want to invest but want to trial run with fake money to start off. Users are asked to enter a request type like view, buy or sell, and changes are made to the database accordingly. Java was used to develop this application with Maven as the build tool. Alpha Vantage API from RapidAPI was accessed using a GET request to access real-time stock information. JDBC was used to view/modify data in PostgreSQL. Testing was completed using Junit and Mockito.",

The application accepts three command-line arguments. The regular expression to search for, the root directory path where the search should begin, and the output file path where the matched lines will be written. Maven was used to build the Java project, Docker was used to containerize the application, and GitHub for source code management."
